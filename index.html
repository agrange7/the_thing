                George A. Romero was an American director known as the "father
                of zombies". Born in 1940, he revolutionized horror cinema with
                his 1968 film "Night of the Living Dead" and continued to
                explore the genre with films such as "Dawn of the Dead" and "Day
                of the Dead". Romero used the horror genre to comment on social
                and political issues, making his films more than just simple
                scares.
              </p>
              <p class="director-popular-paragraph">
                Romero is widely recognized for his influence on popular
                culture, particularly in the zombie subgenre. His films were not
                only innovative in terms of special effects and storytelling but
                also offered biting critiques of society and consumerism. His
                legacy endures through the numerous adaptations and homages to
                his work in film and television.
